                <h2><u>Punch-activated Flamethrower</u></h2>
                <p>Using an Arduino Nano, Butane, and an assortment of hardware store components, I try to mimic the <a href="https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Firebending" target="_blank">firebending</a> antagonists from a childhood show.</p>
                <div class="image-container">

                        <figcaption>Punch in Action</figcaption>
                    </figure>
                </div>
                <p>
                The goal was to make a wrist mounted flamethrower that could track hand motion and then fire when specific 'actions' were detected. 
                A button activation would have been much safer, but in the show the 'firebenders' had to master their element through what resembled martial arts training. 
                So I thought it fitting that I should similarly master my technology. This was heavily inspired by (essentially copied from) <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GS9A1JuOKE8&ab_channel=AllenPan" target="_blank">Allen Pan's attempt</a> at this same device.
                <br><br>
                The Arduino Nano is connected to a 3d accelerometer that continuously monitors the device's acceleration. With this data we can decide what action sequences will
                deem the user worthy of harnessing elemental phlogiston. For example, we could say that the device will only fire when the user's arm is pulled back in a controlled way, held still for a short time 
                to show composure, and released in a punch that is between set min and max accelerations.
                <br><br>
                Once the device has been triggered, a small pneumatic valve opens the butane chamber, releasing a high pressure gas stream in the direction of the punch. There is then a small delay - to let the gas spread for a cooler effect - before an electric lighter ignites the gas.

                <h2><u>Buttons: The Delivery Robot</u></h2>
                <p>Buttons was an autonomous, Raspberry Pi powered robot designed for a university competition. Check out the Github repo <a href="https://github.com/JacksonSprigg/Buttons" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
                <div class="image-container">

                <h4>The Challenge</h4>
                <p>Buttons was required to:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Await packages within a designated loading zone.</li>
                    <li>Distinguish between different types of packages and thus their delivery location (3 possibilities).</li>
                    <li>Navigate to the desired delivery bin while avoiding obstacles and other robots.</li>
                    <li>Deposit the packages and return to the loading zone.</li>
                    <li>Sustain this cycle for the duration of the competition without human interference.</li>
                </ol>

                </p>
                <h4>Overview</h4>
                <p>The optimisation strategies used encompass a 30 page report which, let's be honest, you probably don't care about. So instead, I will outline some of the challenges we faced and how we overcame them:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Localisation with low-quality sensors:</strong> Cross checking and averaging between different sensor types</li>
                    <li><strong>Mapping a dynamic environment from a moving system:</strong> Implemented Vector Field Histograms</li>
                    <li><strong>Efficient path planning around dynamic obstacles:</strong> Developed a custom tentacle cost function</li>
                    <li><strong>Building tests to monitor component health:</strong> Apparently hard coding doesn't work when your low quality components slowly degrade and change values</li>
                    <li><strong>Simulating test environments:</strong> Many hours spent determining real world coefficients</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Overall, Buttons was successful. It could deliver approximately 6 parcels per minute sustained for up to 4 hours (calculated battery time) and achieved the highest team score in the competition.</p>
