                Hi! I'm Jackson.
                <br><br>  
                I recently graduated from Monash University with a double degree in Physics and Engineering (honours), specialising in Robotics and AI.
                <br><br>  
                I'm currently spending my time trying to better understand the AI safety career landscape. 
                <br><br>
                This website is new, if you are reading this it has not yet been populated with my work.
                <br><br>

                and, most importantly, 
                <a href="https://philpapers.org/browse/epistemology" target="_blank">thinking</a> itself. 
                <br><br>
                I equally enjoy tinkering and creating things. The threshold to actualising cool or useful ideas is continually getting lower and lower.
                <br><br>
                Much of my focus is now centred on Artificial Intelligence and its related fields.
                It has 
                <a href="https://gwern.net/scaling-hypothesis" target="_blank">become apparent</a> 
                that we are 
                <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/ai-timelines" target="_blank">nearing the creation</a> 
                of generally intelligent machines.
                And with increasingly intelligent systems, <a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/aiQabnugDhcrFtr9n/the-power-of-intelligence" target="_blank">we find solutions</a> to increasingly difficult problems.   
                The promises are infinitely beguiling.     
                Unfortunately, utopic ideals are rarely kind to starry eyes, and in this case, the creation of entities more intelligent than ourselves poses — 
                <a href="https://www.safe.ai/work/statement-on-ai-risk#open-letter" target="_blank">acknowledged</a>
                — 
                <a href="https://www.alignmentforum.org/s/mzgtmmTKKn5MuCzFJ" target="_blank">existential risks</a>. 
                I’m not exactly sure where I can fit into this picture, but I hope to make an impact.
