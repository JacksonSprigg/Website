                <p>Using an Arduino Nano, Butane, and an assortment of hardware store components, I try to mimic the <a href="https://youtu.be/Y7DhuekqsO8?si=1mv7zb6tt6ohkxl5" target="_blank">firebending</a> antagonists from a childhood show.</p>

                        <figcaption>The Device</figcaption>

                        <img src="media/flamethrower_action.png" alt="Flamethrower in Action" class="project-image">
                        <figcaption>Punch in Action</figcaption>
                    </figure>
                </div>
                <p>
                The goal was to make a wrist mounted flamethrower that could track hand motion and then fire when specific 'actions' were detected. 
                A button activation would have been much safer, but in the show the 'firebenders' had to master their element through what resembled martial arts training. 
                So I thought it fitting that I should similarly master my technology. This was heavily inspired by (essentially copied from) <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GS9A1JuOKE8&ab_channel=AllenPan" target="_blank">Allen Pan's attempt</a> at this same device.
                <br><br>
                The Arduino Nano is connected to a 3d accelerometer that continuously monitors the device's acceleration. With this data we can decide what action sequences will
                deem the user worthy of harnessing elemental phlogiston. For example, we could say that the device will only fire when the user's arm is pulled back in a controlled way, held still for a short time 
                to show composure, and released in a punch that is between set min and max accelerations.
                <br><br>
                Once the device has been triggered, a small pneumatic valve opens the butane chamber, releasing a high pressure gas stream in the direction of the punch. There is then a small delay - to let the gas spread for a better visual effect - before an electric lighter ignites the gas.
