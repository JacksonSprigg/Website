                <p>
                Like many kids who grew up watching <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avatar:_The_Last_Airbender" target="_blank">Avatar: The Last Airbender</a>, I thought the <a href="https://youtu.be/Y7DhuekqsO8?si=1mv7zb6tt6ohkxl5" target="_blank">firebenders</a> were incredibly cool. 
                I mean, truly, what is cooler than being able to telekinetically manipulate fire through martial arts movements?
                I often fantasised about having this ability myself. So, as a slightly more competent teenager, I realised this dream by building a wrist-mounted, martial-arts-motion-tracking flamethrower.

                The device is built around an Arduino Nano connected to a 3D accelerometer that continuously monitors acceleration. With the acceleration data we can decide what motion — or sequence of motions — will
                deem the user worthy of harnessing <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phlogiston_theory" target="_blank">elemental phlogiston</a>. For example, we could say that the device will only release fire when the user's arm is pulled back in a controlled way, held still for a short time 
                to show composure, and released in a controlled punch that is between a set range of acceleration.
                <br><br>
                Once the Arduino has detected one of the pre-set action sequences, it opens a small pneumatic valve connected to an on-board pressurised gas chamber (an enclosed steel pipe). 
                This releases a stream of butane in the direction of the punch. There is then a small, set delay — to let the gas spread for a better visual effect — before a high-voltage arc lighter ignites the gas.
